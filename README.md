Cross-platform desktop application featuring a **Database Editor** for the [AzerothCore MMORPG framework](http://www.azerothcore.org).

With Keira3 you don't have to know the SQL language in order to change contents: it will generate the SQL queries automatically for you. The SQL code will be displayed, so you can **learn**, and then you can **copy** or **execute** it directly to your database.

Made with ‚ù§ and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Support us

You can support the Keira3 development by [donating with PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/francesco92dev).

## Inspired by

We created Keira inspired by the old [indomit's Quice/Truice](https://github.com/indomit/quice) database editor, and by the [Discover-'s SAI Editor](https://github.com/jasperrietrae/SAI-Editor). Our primary goal was to provide an editor with the same features that was cross-platform, so we built it as a web app.

Keira3 is the direct successor of [Keira2](https://github.com/Helias/Keira2). We kept the cross-platform promise as well as adding the possibility to execute the generated queries and simplifying the application setup.

## AzerothCore Database

In order to use Keira3 you have to connect to an instance of the [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) Database.

If you don't have any, you can easily create one following [this guide](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/database-only-quick-setup).

Alternatively, you can use a public database of AzerothCore with read-only access. Details [here](https://github.com/azerothcore/forum/issues/84).

## How to install Keira3

To use Keira3, you don't need to install any dependency. Just [download](https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3/releases) and run it.

:warning: [Windows 7 or older Windows versions](https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3/issues/2212) are not officially supported.

### Troubleshooting

If Keira3 does not start after installing it on Linux via a package (e.g., `.deb`), try launching it from the terminal for debugging:  

```bash
keira3
```

If you encounter the following error:  

```
[72215:0401/191915.555407:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(163)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing, I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/Keira3/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
trace/breakpoint (core dump)
```  

You can resolve this issue by running:  

```bash
sudo chmod 4755 /opt/Keira3/chrome-sandbox
```  

This command sets the correct permissions for the `chrome-sandbox` file, ensuring Keira3 runs properly.  

## How to run Keira3 in development mode

### Dependencies

**Note:** these are the dependencies if you want to run Keira3 in development mode. If you just want to use Keira3, download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3/releases).

You need to first install [node](https://nodejs.org) in order to have `npm` available in your system.

This project uses [NX](https://nx.dev/), you can install it globally using `npm install -g nx@latest`

Then install the dependencies using:

``` bash
npm install
```

Only for **Windows** ([Windows 7 or older versions](https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3/issues/2212) are not officially supported), install `windows-build-tools` as administrator:
```
npm install --global-production windows-build-tools
```
This installation will take time and probably your PC will **reboot** during the installation.

### Running checks on projects

The entire codebse is organised in [NX](https://nx.dev/) projects (apps and libraries), that are located in:

- `apps/*`
- `libs/*`

All lib paths are declared in the [tsconfig.base.json](https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3/blob/master/tsconfig.base.json) and their names are:

- `keira-path-name-of-the-project`

Examples:

- `keira-features-smart-scripts`
- `keira-main-connection-window`
- `keira-shared-base-editor-components`

You can run checks such as `lint` or `test` of any project using:

- `nx lint project-name`
- `nx test project-name`

Examples:

- `nx lint keira`
- `nx lint keira-shared-utils`
- `nx test keira-features-creature`

### Run the app

To run the app in local development with hot reload:

```bash
npm start
```

More commands:
