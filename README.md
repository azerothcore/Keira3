# Keira3

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e9d97b0240fd452487bfd5d3e55da96f)](https://app.codacy.com/app/FrancescoBorzi/Keira3?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=azerothcore/Keira3&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Cross-platform desktop application featuring a **Database Editor** for the [AzerothCore MMORPG framework](http://www.azerothcore.org).

With Keira3 you don't have to know the SQL language in order to change contents: it will generate the SQL queries automatically for you. The SQL code will be displayed, so you can **learn**, and then you can **copy** or **execute** it directly to your database.

Made with ‚ù§ and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Work in progress

Keira3 is currently in a WIP state. All the news and releases will be announced via [the forum](https://github.com/azerothcore/forum/issues/21).

## Support us

You can support the Keira3 development by [donating with PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=1X08XHBNzJj9FK0UvHhg4cKvMNCidCt6MW10hZD3iXwv4Xnq2pT0gcXyuZpgLVEKpwBA0W&country.x=IT&locale.x=en_US&Z3JncnB0=).

## Inspired by

We created Keira inspired by the old [indomit's Quice/Truice](https://github.com/indomit/quice) database editor, and by the [Discover-'s SAI Editor](https://github.com/Discover-/SAI-Editor). Our primary goal was to provide an editor with the same features that was cross-platform, so we built it as a web app.

Keira3 is the direct successor of [Keira2](https://github.com/Helias/Keira2). We kept the cross-platform promise as well as adding the possibility to execute the generated queries and simplifying the application setup.

## AzerothCore Database

In order to use Keira3 you have to connect to an instance of the [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) Database.

If you don't have any, you can easily create one following [this guide](http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/database-only-quick-setup).
